			<h1>Resume Page</h1>
			<p>I would like this resume page to be a very condensed page designed for those who only spend 20 seconds reading a resume.</p>
			I would like to highlite the parts that I think are important for the 20 second once over.  I would like for my resume to have hidden text for those who actually wish to disect my resume.  All they would have to do is click on something of interest and the text will expand.<p></p>

			<h1>Portfolio Page</h1>
			<p>On this page, I am going to expain that the programming projects that I worked on are concidered company propriotary and the companies that I worked for would not appreciate me displaying them concidering that I signed a confidentially agreement.  I will post a programming assignment from a class that I took last semester and explain in detail what it does.  I would like to use highlight js in order to show all the color for the c code.</p>
