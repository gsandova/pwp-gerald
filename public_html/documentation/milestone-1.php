		<h1>Persona</h1>
		<h2>Name</h2>
		<p>Patrick Orthagonal</p>
		<h2>Age</h2>
		<p>middle to older</p>

		<h2>Profession</h2>
		<p>Patrick is the program manager for Acme which is a small high tech company that contracts with the defense department to develop web based applications with corresponding phone apps.</p>

		<h2>Technology</h2>
		<p>PC and linux user</p>

		<h2>Attitudes and Behaviors</h2>
		<p>Since Patrick works for a small company, he must play many roles and is always short on time.  Patrick will spend no more than 3 minutes max looking at anyoneâ€™s portfolio site, and only about 30 seconds on a resume.  In Patricks own words, "I don't believe in prostituting myself on social media".  However, he is well aware of the power of social media and uses it as a tool for hiring.</p>

		<h2>Frustrations and Needs</h2>
		<p>Patrick needs to hire somebody with a diverse technology background and with a good personality who will fit in the culture as well. Acme is small company and needs a person with a diverse background as the job requires work on many types of projects with varying skills. Patrick is frustrated with the typical computer science major who knows programming well but only knows programming.  </p>

		<h2>Goals</h2>
		<p>Patrick is only concerned with one thing: Is this person a potential candidate for the position at Acme? Can Patrick, within 3 minutes max, determine whether this person is worthy of a preliminary phone screen regarding the job? Patrick can't afford to waste time. Patrick needs to know via a very fast interaction with the site whether or not this potential candidate has the minimum qualifications to warrant a call.</p>
